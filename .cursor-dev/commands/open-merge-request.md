# Open Merge Request to Main

## Overview
Prepare a feature branch and open a merge request (MR/PR) to merge it into main. Ensure the branch is ready, tested, and includes all necessary context. Reference `engineer-playbook.md` for standards and best practices.

## Steps
1. **Prepare the feature branch**
   - Ensure the feature branch is up-to-date with main
   - Pull the latest main branch and resolve conflicts locally
   - Confirm all tests pass (unit, integration, edge cases)
   - Verify acceptance criteria have been met

2. **Open the merge request / pull request**
   - Target branch: main
   - Include:
     - Clear, descriptive title
     - Summary of changes
     - References to plan work, design, and `engineer-playbook.md`
     - Notes on testing and verification performed

## Checklist
- [ ] Feature branch up-to-date with main and conflicts resolved
- [ ] All tests passed and acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Merge request opened with descriptive title and notes

# Design Solution

## Overview
Design a clear, low-risk solution that satisfies all acceptance criteria **before implementation**.

## Steps
1. **Confirm scope and goals**
   - Revisit acceptance criteria
   - Identify non-negotiables
   - Explicitly state what is out of scope

2. **Evaluate solution options**
   - List 1–3 viable approaches
   - Compare trade-offs (complexity, risk, effort)
   - Select the simplest approach that meets requirements

3. **Define system changes**
   - Components to modify or add
   - APIs, data models, or state changes
   - Error handling and failure modes
   - What will not change

4. **Risk mitigation**
   - Address risks identified during analysis
   - Plan safeguards (feature flags, rollback, compatibility)
   - Note any remaining risks

5. **Testability considerations**
   - How the solution will be unit tested
   - Required integration or end-to-end tests
   - How failure cases can be validated

6. **Validation and review**
   - Sanity-check against acceptance criteria
   - Identify areas needing peer review
   - Document final design decisions

## Design Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria addressed
- [ ] Chosen solution is the simplest viable option
- [ ] Risks reduced or contained
- [ ] Design is testable
- [ ] Scope and boundaries are clear

# Task Analysis

## Overview
Structured analysis of a ticket to fully understand requirements, define “done,” and identify risks **before implementation**.

## Steps
1. **Problem understanding**
   - Restate the issue clearly
   - Identify current vs expected behavior
   - Determine who is affected
   - Classify task (bug, feature, regression, etc.)

2. **Requirements extraction**
   - Identify functional requirements
   - Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
   - Note constraints and dependencies
   - Document ambiguities (no assumptions)

3. **Acceptance criteria**
   - Define testable success conditions
   - Identify failure scenarios
   - Capture key edge cases
   - Specify user- and system-visible outcomes

4. **Risk identification**
   - Technical risks (complexity, legacy, concurrency)
   - Integration risks (external services, contracts)
   - Operational risks (performance, data integrity)
   - Timeline risks (dependencies, unclear scope)

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Problem can be clearly restated
- [ ] Requirements are explicit and documented
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Major risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] Open questions documented before coding

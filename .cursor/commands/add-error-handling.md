# Add Error Handling

Makes your code handle problems gracefully so when something goes wrong, your website doesn't break and users get helpful messages.

1. **Find problems**
   - Look for places where things could go wrong
   - Find missing checks
   - See what could break

2. **Handle errors nicely**
   - Catch errors before they break things
   - Show helpful messages to users
   - Log what went wrong so you can fix it

3. **Make it recover**
   - Try again if something fails temporarily
   - Have backup plans
   - Keep the website working even if something breaks

## What to Tell the User

- Explain you're making their code more reliable
- Show them what errors you're handling
- Explain how the website will handle problems now
- Make sure they understand the improvements

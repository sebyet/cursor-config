# Run Tests

Runs tests to verify your code works correctly. Checks for test failures, runs test suites, and ensures everything passes before deploying.

1. **Find and run tests**
   - Check for test files in the project
   - Identify test framework being used (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, etc.)
   - Run test suites
   - Check for test failures
   - Tell the user what you found

2. **Report test results**
   - Show test results (passed/failed)
   - List any failing tests
   - Show test coverage if available
   - Explain what tests are checking

3. **Fix failing tests (if needed)**
   - Identify why tests are failing
   - Fix test issues
   - Re-run tests to verify fixes
   - Make sure all tests pass

## What to Tell the User

- Explain you're running tests to verify everything works
- Show test results as they run
- List any failing tests clearly
- Fix failing tests automatically if possible
- Tell them when all tests pass

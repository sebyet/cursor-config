- Identifying attack vectors
- Testing security controls
- Simulating attacks
- Documenting vulnerabilities
- Recommending fixes

## How It Works

1. **Define Test Scope**
   - Ask about systems to test
   - Identify test boundaries
   - Understand security goals
   - Get authorization

2. **Perform Penetration Test**
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Test security controls
   - Simulate attacks
   - Document findings

3. **Generate Test Report**
   - Create penetration test report
   - Document vulnerabilities
   - Prioritize findings
   - Recommend fixes

## What to Tell the User

- "What systems do you want to penetration test?"
- "What's your test scope and authorization?"
- Perform penetration test
- "Penetration test complete! Vulnerabilities found: [list]. Severity: [critical/high/medium/low]. Recommendations: [list]"

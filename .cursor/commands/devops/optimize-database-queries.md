# Optimize Database Queries

Optimize database queries for improved performance and reduced load.

## What This Command Does

Optimizes queries by:
- Analyzing slow queries
- Optimizing query execution plans
- Creating optimal indexes
- Rewriting inefficient queries
- Generating optimization recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Query Optimization Needs**
   - Ask about slow queries
   - Identify database type
   - Understand performance issues
   - Determine optimization scope

2. **Analyze and Optimize**
   - Analyze query performance
   - Optimize execution plans
   - Create indexes
   - Rewrite queries

3. **Verify and Document**
   - Verify improvements
   - Measure performance gains
   - Document optimizations
   - Generate recommendations

## What to Tell the User

- "What queries are slow or need optimization?"
- "What database are you using?"
- Analyze and optimize queries
- "Query optimization complete! Queries: [optimized]. Performance: [improved]. Indexes: [created]"

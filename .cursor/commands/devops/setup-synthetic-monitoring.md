# Setup Synthetic Monitoring

Configure synthetic monitoring and uptime checks for applications and services.

## What This Command Does

Sets up synthetic monitoring by:
- Creating uptime checks and health endpoints
- Setting up synthetic transactions
- Configuring monitoring locations
- Establishing alerting for downtime
- Setting up performance monitoring

## How It Works

1. **Understand Monitoring Needs**
   - Ask about endpoints to monitor
   - Identify critical user flows
   - Understand monitoring locations
   - Determine check frequency

2. **Design Synthetic Monitoring**
   - Create uptime checks
   - Set up synthetic transactions
   - Configure monitoring locations
   - Define alert thresholds

3. **Generate Configuration**
   - Create monitoring checks
   - Set up alerts
   - Configure locations
   - Document setup steps

## What to Tell the User

- "What endpoints or user flows should we monitor?"
- "What monitoring locations do you need? (regions, countries)"
- Generate synthetic monitoring configuration
- "Synthetic monitoring setup complete! Checks: [count]. Locations: [list]. Alerts: [configured]"

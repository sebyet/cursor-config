# Cost Optimization

Analyze and optimize cloud costs to reduce infrastructure spending.

## What This Command Does

Optimizes cloud costs by:
- Analyzing cloud cost reports
- Identifying cost optimization opportunities
- Setting up cost alerts and budgets
- Optimizing resource usage
- Generating cost optimization recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Current Costs**
   - Ask about cloud provider and cost data
   - Review cost reports and trends
   - Identify high-cost resources
   - Analyze cost by service/resource
   - Understand cost drivers

2. **Identify Optimization Opportunities**
   - Find unused or underutilized resources
   - Identify over-provisioned resources
   - Find cost-effective alternatives
   - Identify reserved instance opportunities
   - Find storage optimization opportunities

3. **Generate Optimization Plan**
   - Prioritize optimization opportunities
   - Calculate potential savings
   - Create optimization recommendations
   - Set up cost budgets and alerts
   - Document optimization plan

4. **Implement and Monitor**
   - Implement cost optimizations
   - Set up cost monitoring
   - Track cost savings
   - Generate cost reports
   - Document optimization results

## What to Tell the User

- "What cloud provider are you using?"
- "What cost data do you have?"
- "What's your cost optimization goal?"
- Analyze costs and generate optimization plan
- "Cost optimization complete! Opportunities: [count]. Potential savings: [amount]. Recommendations: [list]"

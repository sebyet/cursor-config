# Optimize Infrastructure

Optimize infrastructure costs, performance, and resource utilization.

## What This Command Does

Optimizes infrastructure by:
- Analyzing resource usage
- Identifying cost optimization opportunities
- Recommending performance improvements
- Suggesting scaling strategies
- Creating optimization plan

## How It Works

1. **Understand Infrastructure**
   - Ask about current infrastructure
   - Get resource usage data
   - Understand costs
   - Identify performance goals

2. **Analyze Infrastructure**
   - Review resource usage
   - Identify inefficiencies
   - Find cost savings
   - Assess performance

3. **Generate Optimization Plan**
   - Create recommendations
   - Prioritize optimizations
   - Estimate savings
   - Provide implementation steps

## What to Tell the User

- "What infrastructure do you want to optimize?"
- "What are your current costs and usage?"
- Analyze and generate optimization plan
- "Infrastructure optimization complete! Recommendations: [list]. Estimated savings: [amount]"

- Checking infrastructure configurations
- Identifying outdated packages
- Generating vulnerability report

## How It Works

1. **Define Check Scope**
   - Ask what to check
   - Identify dependency sources
   - Understand codebase
   - Get vulnerability database access

2. **Scan for Vulnerabilities**
   - Check dependencies
   - Review code patterns
   - Scan infrastructure
   - Identify known CVEs

3. **Generate Report**
   - List vulnerabilities found
   - Prioritize by severity
   - Suggest fixes
   - Provide update paths

## What to Tell the User

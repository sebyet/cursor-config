# Code Metrics

Analyze code quality metrics including cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and technical debt.

## What This Command Does

Analyzes code metrics by:
- Calculating cyclomatic complexity
- Measuring code coverage
- Analyzing technical debt
- Identifying code smells
- Generating metrics reports
- Providing improvement recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Metrics Needs**
   - Ask about metrics to analyze
   - Identify code areas to measure
   - Understand quality goals
   - Get context on codebase

2. **Calculate Code Metrics**
   - Run complexity analysis
   - Measure code coverage
   - Analyze technical debt
   - Identify code smells
   - Calculate maintainability index
   - Analyze dependency metrics

3. **Generate Metrics Report**
   - Create metrics dashboard
   - Highlight problem areas
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Provide recommendations
   - Set quality thresholds

4. **Provide Improvement Plan**
   - Prioritize improvements
   - Suggest refactoring opportunities
   - Recommend test coverage goals
   - Provide implementation steps

## What to Tell the User

- "What code metrics do you want to analyze?"
- Calculate and analyze metrics
- "Code metrics analysis complete! Complexity: [score]. Coverage: [percentage]. Technical debt: [details]. Recommendations: [list]"

# API Mocking

Set up API mocking for development and testing with mock service responses.

## What This Command Does

Sets up API mocking by:
- Configuring mock services
- Creating mock API responses
- Setting up mock data
- Configuring mock scenarios
- Integrating with development workflow

## How It Works

1. **Understand Mocking Needs**
   - Ask about APIs to mock
   - Identify mock scenarios
   - Understand response formats
   - Get context on use cases

2. **Set Up Mock Service**
   - Choose mocking tool (MSW recommended)
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure mock service
   - Set up mock handlers
   - Configure mock data

3. **Create Mock Responses**
   - Define mock endpoints
   - Create response templates
   - Set up mock scenarios
   - Add error responses
   - Configure response delays

4. **Integrate Mocking**
   - Integrate with development
   - Set up test integration
   - Configure environment switching
   - Add mock utilities
   - Document mock setup

## What to Tell the User

- "What APIs do you want to mock?"
- "What mock scenarios do you need?"
- Set up API mocking
- "API mocking setup complete! Mock service: [name]. Mock endpoints: [count]. Usage: [instructions]"

# Debug Performance

Debug and optimize performance issues in your application. Identifies bottlenecks, memory leaks, and slow code paths.

## What This Command Does

Helps debug performance by:
- Profiling slow code paths
- Identifying performance bottlenecks
- Detecting memory leaks
- Optimizing rendering performance
- Analyzing bundle impact
- Generating performance reports

## How It Works

1. **Understand Performance Issue**
   - Ask about performance problem
   - Identify symptoms (slow page load, laggy interactions, memory issues)
   - Get context on when it occurs
   - Understand user impact

2. **Profile Performance**
   - Set up performance profiling
   - Run performance analysis
   - Identify slow components
   - Find memory leaks
   - Analyze network requests
   - Check bundle size impact

3. **Identify Bottlenecks**
   - Analyze profiling data
   - Identify slow code paths
   - Find rendering issues
   - Detect unnecessary re-renders
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Find inefficient queries

4. **Generate Optimization Plan**
   - Create optimization recommendations
   - Prioritize fixes by impact
   - Suggest code changes
   - Recommend performance patterns
   - Provide implementation steps

5. **Implement Optimizations**
   - Apply performance fixes
   - Optimize rendering
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add memoization
   - Optimize queries
   - Reduce bundle size

## What to Tell the User

- "What performance issue are you experiencing?"
- "When does the slowness occur?"
- Profile and analyze performance
- "Performance analysis complete! Bottlenecks: [list]. Recommendations: [list]"
- Implement optimizations
- "Performance optimizations applied! Expected improvements: [details]"

# Optimize Bundle

Analyze and optimize bundle size through code splitting, tree shaking, and lazy loading.

## What This Command Does

Optimizes bundle by:
- Analyzing bundle size
- Identifying large dependencies
- Implementing code splitting
- Applying tree shaking
- Adding lazy loading
- Optimizing imports
- Generating bundle reports

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Bundle Size**
   - Run bundle analysis
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Find duplicate code
   - Check import patterns
   - Analyze chunk sizes

2. **Identify Optimization Opportunities**
   - Find large libraries
   - Identify unused code
   - Find duplicate dependencies
   - Check dynamic imports
   - Analyze code splitting opportunities

3. **Implement Optimizations**
   - Add code splitting
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Remove unused code
   - Optimize imports
   - Replace large dependencies
   - Configure tree shaking

4. **Verify Improvements**
   - Measure bundle size reduction
   - Check load time improvements
   - Verify functionality
   - Test performance impact
   - Generate optimization report

## What to Tell the User

- "Analyzing bundle size..."
- Analyze bundle
- "Bundle analysis complete! Current size: [size]. Large dependencies: [list]. Optimization opportunities: [list]"
- Implement optimizations
- "Bundle optimized! Size reduced by [percentage]. New size: [size]. Improvements: [list]"

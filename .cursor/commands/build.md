# Build

**In plain English:** Tell me what you want to add or change, and I'll build it for you automatically.

## What This Command Does

**For non-technical users:** This is like having a developer who builds exactly what you describe. Just tell me what you want in plain English, and I'll:
- Build it automatically
- **Automatically check design and accessibility** (happens invisibly - I make sure it looks good and everyone can use it)
- Show you a preview so you can see it
- Make sure it works properly
- Clean everything up when you're happy

**Examples of what you can say:**
- "Add a contact form"
- "Add a blue button that says Sign Up"
- "Update the login page"
- "Remove the old newsletter signup"

## How It Works

1. **You tell me what you want**
   - Just describe it in plain English - no technical terms needed!
   - Examples: "Add a button", "Create a form", "Update the homepage"

2. **I build it automatically**
   - I figure out what you need
   - I build it step by step
   - **I automatically check design and accessibility** (happens invisibly)
   - I show you what I'm doing

3. **You see a preview**
   - I start a preview server (don't worry about what this means - it just shows your work)
   - You see it in your browser
   - You check if it looks good

4. **You confirm it's good**
   - If it looks good, you say "looks good!" or "yes"
   - I finish everything automatically (testing, cleaning up, documenting)

5. **Done!**
   - Your feature is ready to use!

## Usage Examples

**Simple:**
- `@build` → "Add a contact form"
- `@build` → "Add a blue button"

**More complex:**
- `@build` → "Update the login page to add social login buttons"
- `@build` → "Create a user dashboard with profile and settings"

**Removing things:**
- `@build` → "Remove the old newsletter signup"

## What to Tell the User

**First time users:**
- "Hi! I can help you build features. Just tell me what you want to add or change in plain English. For example: 'Add a contact form' or 'Add a blue button that says Sign Up'."

**Regular users:**
- "What would you like to build? Just describe it in plain English."
- If they're unsure: "You can say things like 'Add a button', 'Create a form', or 'Update a page'. What would you like to build?"

**After building:**
- "I've built your feature! Let me show you a preview..."
- "Does this look good? If yes, I'll finish everything up automatically."
- "Done! Your feature is ready. Here's what I built: [summary]"

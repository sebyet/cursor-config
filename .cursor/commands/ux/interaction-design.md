# Interaction Design

Design interactions and behaviors to create intuitive and delightful user experiences.

## What This Command Does

Creates interaction designs by:
- Designing interaction patterns
- Specifying interaction behaviors
- Designing micro-interactions
- Creating interaction specifications
- Documenting interaction design decisions

## How It Works

1. **Understand Interaction Needs**
   - Ask about feature or component to design
   - Identify user goals and tasks
   - Understand interaction context
   - Get context on design system
   - Determine interaction scope

2. **Design Interactions**
   - Design interaction patterns
   - Specify user actions and system responses
   - Design micro-interactions and feedback
   - Plan interaction states (hover, active, disabled)
   - Design error handling and recovery

3. **Specify Interaction Details**
   - Document interaction behaviors
   - Specify timing and animations
   - Define feedback mechanisms
   - Document edge cases and error states
   - Create interaction specifications

4. **Generate Interaction Documentation**
   - Create interaction design document
   - Include behavior specifications
   - Document interaction patterns
   - Provide implementation guidance
   - Make it ready for development

## What to Tell the User

- "What interactions do you want to design?"
- "What's the user goal or task?"
- "What's the interaction context?"
- Design interactions and behaviors
- "Interaction design complete! Patterns: [list]. Specifications: [created]. Ready for implementation."

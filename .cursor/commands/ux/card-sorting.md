# Card Sorting

Conduct card sorting studies to understand how users organize information and validate information architecture.

## What This Command Does

Conducts card sorting by:
- Planning card sorting studies
- Creating card sorting tasks
- Analyzing card sorting results
- Using results to inform IA decisions
- Comparing open vs. closed card sorting

## How It Works

1. **Plan Card Sorting Study**
   - Ask about content to organize
   - Determine card sorting type (open, closed, hybrid)
   - Identify participants needed
   - Plan study logistics
   - Define success criteria

2. **Create Card Sorting Materials**
   - Create cards with content items
   - Design card sorting interface or physical setup
   - Prepare instructions for participants
   - Set up data collection method
   - Test card sorting setup

3. **Conduct Card Sorting**
   - Facilitate card sorting sessions
   - Observe participant behavior
   - Collect sorting data
   - Note participant comments and rationale
   - Document findings

4. **Analyze Results**
   - Analyze sorting patterns
   - Identify content groupings
   - Find consensus and disagreements
   - Generate similarity matrix
   - Create card sorting analysis report

5. **Apply to Information Architecture**
   - Use results to inform IA structure
   - Validate or refine navigation
   - Update content organization
   - Document IA decisions based on results
   - Create implementation guide

## What to Tell the User

- "What content needs to be organized?"
- "What type of card sorting? (open, closed, hybrid)"
- "How many participants?"
- Conduct card sorting study
- "Card sorting complete! Patterns: [summary]. IA recommendations: [list]. Ready to update structure."

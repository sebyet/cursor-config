# Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluate interfaces against usability heuristics (Nielsen's 10 heuristics) to identify usability issues quickly.

## What This Command Does

Performs heuristic evaluation by:
- Evaluating interface against usability principles
- Identifying heuristic violations
- Prioritizing usability issues
- Generating heuristic evaluation reports
- Comparing multiple design options

## How It Works

1. **Define Evaluation Scope**
   - Ask what to evaluate (feature, page, flow)
   - Identify which heuristics to use (Nielsen's 10, custom set)
   - Understand evaluation goals
   - Get access to interface or design

2. **Evaluate Against Heuristics**
   - Review interface systematically
   - Check against each heuristic principle
   - Identify violations and issues
   - Document findings with examples
   - Note severity of each issue

3. **Prioritize Issues**
   - Categorize issues by heuristic
   - Assess severity (critical, major, minor)
   - Identify frequency and impact
   - Prioritize fixes
   - Group related issues

4. **Generate Evaluation Report**
   - Create comprehensive evaluation document
   - List issues by heuristic and priority
   - Include examples and screenshots
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Suggest fixes and improvements

## What to Tell the User

- "What do you want to evaluate?"
- "Which heuristics should we use? (Nielsen's 10, custom set)"
- Evaluate interface against heuristics
- "Heuristic evaluation complete! Issues found: [count]. Critical: [list]. Recommendations: [list]"

# Information Architecture

Design and organize information architecture to structure content and navigation effectively.

## What This Command Does

Creates information architecture by:
- Designing site structure and navigation
- Organizing content hierarchies
- Creating sitemaps and content models
- Planning information architecture improvements
- Documenting IA decisions

## How It Works

1. **Understand Content and Goals**
   - Ask about content types and volume
   - Identify user goals and tasks
   - Understand business objectives
   - Get context on existing structure
   - Determine scope of IA work

2. **Design Information Architecture**
   - Organize content into logical groups
   - Create content hierarchies
   - Design navigation structure
   - Plan content relationships
   - Design labeling and taxonomy

3. **Create IA Documentation**
   - Generate sitemap
   - Create content models
   - Document navigation structure
   - Define content categories
   - Create IA specifications

4. **Validate and Refine**
   - Review IA with stakeholders
   - Test with users (card sorting, tree testing)
   - Refine based on feedback
   - Document final IA decisions
   - Create implementation guide

## What to Tell the User

- "What content needs to be organized?"
- "What are the main user goals and tasks?"
- "What's the current structure?"
- Design information architecture
- "Information architecture created! Structure: [summary]. Sitemap: [created]. Ready for implementation."

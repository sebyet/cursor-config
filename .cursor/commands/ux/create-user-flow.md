# Create User Flow

Create detailed user flow diagrams to visualize specific task flows and decision points.

## What This Command Does

Creates user flows by:
- Mapping detailed user flows for specific tasks
- Documenting decision points and branches
- Identifying flow optimization opportunities
- Creating flow diagrams for development handoff
- Comparing alternative flow options

## How It Works

1. **Define Flow Scope**
   - Ask about the user flow to create
   - Identify starting and ending points
   - Understand user persona and context
   - Determine flow granularity
   - Get context on related flows

2. **Map User Flow**
   - Document each step in the flow
   - Identify decision points and branches
   - Map user actions and system responses
   - Note error states and edge cases
   - Document alternative paths

3. **Create Flow Diagram**
   - Generate visual flow diagram
   - Include decision points and branches
   - Show user actions and system states
   - Highlight pain points and friction
   - Create flow documentation

4. **Optimize and Refine**
   - Identify flow improvements
   - Compare alternative flows
   - Suggest optimizations
   - Document final flow
   - Create implementation guide

## What to Tell the User

- "What user flow do you want to create?"
- "What's the starting and ending point?"
- "Who is the user? What's the context?"
- Create user flow diagram
- "User flow created! Steps: [count]. Decision points: [count]. Optimizations: [list]"

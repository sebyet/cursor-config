Create empathy maps to understand user context, emotions, and motivations deeply.

## What This Command Does

Creates empathy maps by:
- Mapping user thoughts, feelings, actions, and pain points
- Understanding user context and environment
- Identifying emotional triggers and motivations
- Creating empathy maps for different user segments
- Using empathy maps to inform design decisions

## How It Works

1. **Define User Segment**
   - Ask about user segment to map
   - Identify user persona or research data
   - Understand user context and situation
   - Get insights from research or interviews
   - Determine mapping focus

2. **Create Empathy Map**
   - Map what user says (quotes, feedback)
   - Map what user thinks (thoughts, beliefs)
   - Map what user does (actions, behaviors)
   - Map what user feels (emotions, frustrations)
   - Identify pain points and gains

3. **Analyze and Synthesize**
   - Identify patterns and themes
   - Find emotional triggers
   - Understand motivations and goals
   - Note contradictions and tensions
   - Extract key insights

4. **Generate Empathy Map Document**
   - Create visual empathy map
   - Document insights and findings
   - Highlight key pain points and gains
   - Suggest design implications
   - Make it actionable for design/dev

## What to Tell the User

- "What user segment do you want to create an empathy map for?"
- "What research data do you have about these users?"
- "What's the user context or situation?"
- Create empathy map
- "Empathy map created! Key insights: [list]. Pain points: [list]. Use this to guide design decisions."

# Task Analysis

Analyze and break down user tasks to understand workflows and identify optimization opportunities.

## What This Command Does

Performs task analysis by:
- Breaking down user tasks into steps
- Identifying task goals and sub-goals
- Documenting task flows and dependencies
- Identifying pain points in task completion
- Optimizing task flows

## How It Works

1. **Define Task to Analyze**
   - Ask about the task to analyze
   - Identify user persona and context
   - Understand task goals and outcomes
   - Get context on current task flow
   - Determine analysis depth

2. **Break Down Task**
   - Identify task steps and actions
   - Document decision points
   - Map task flow and dependencies
   - Identify sub-tasks and sub-goals
   - Note task variations and edge cases

3. **Analyze Task Flow**
   - Identify pain points and friction
   - Find inefficiencies and bottlenecks
   - Document user mental model
   - Note cognitive load and complexity
   - Identify error-prone steps

4. **Generate Analysis and Recommendations**
   - Create task flow documentation
   - Prioritize pain points
   - Suggest optimizations
   - Recommend improvements
   - Create task flow diagrams

## What to Tell the User

- "What task do you want to analyze?"
- "Who is the user? What's the context?"
- "What's the goal of this task?"
- Analyze task and break down workflow
- "Task analysis complete! Steps: [count]. Pain points: [list]. Recommendations: [list]"

# Funnel Optimization

Analyze and optimize conversion funnels to identify drop-offs and improve conversion rates.

## What This Command Does

Optimizes funnels by:
- Analyzing conversion funnels
- Identifying drop-off points
- Optimizing conversion paths
- Testing funnel improvements
- Tracking funnel metrics
- Generating optimization recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Funnel**
   - Ask about conversion funnel
   - Identify funnel stages
   - Understand user journey
   - Get conversion data

2. **Analyze Funnel**
   - Map funnel stages
   - Calculate conversion rates
   - Identify drop-off points
   - Find bottlenecks
   - Analyze user behavior

3. **Identify Optimization Opportunities**
   - Find friction points
   - Identify improvement areas
   - Analyze user drop-offs
   - Find conversion barriers
   - Prioritize optimizations

4. **Implement Optimizations**
   - Optimize funnel stages
   - Remove friction
   - Improve conversion paths
   - Add conversion elements
   - Test improvements

5. **Track Results**
   - Monitor funnel metrics
   - Track conversion improvements
   - Analyze A/B test results
   - Generate optimization report

## What to Tell the User

- "What conversion funnel do you want to optimize?"
- "What are your funnel stages?"
- Analyze and optimize funnel
- "Funnel optimization complete! Drop-offs identified: [list]. Optimizations: [applied]. Expected improvement: [percentage]"

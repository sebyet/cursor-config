# Setup A/B Test

Set up A/B tests to compare variants and measure impact on key metrics.

## What This Command Does

Sets up A/B tests by:
- Defining test hypothesis
- Creating test variants
- Setting up tracking
- Configuring test parameters
- Creating implementation plan

## How It Works

1. **Understand Test Goals**
   - Ask about what to test
   - Identify hypothesis
   - Understand success metrics
   - Get context on variants

2. **Design A/B Test**
   - Define test hypothesis
   - Create variant descriptions
   - Set up tracking plan
   - Configure test parameters

3. **Generate Test Setup**
   - Create test configuration
   - Document implementation steps
   - Set up tracking
   - Provide execution plan

## What to Tell the User

- "What do you want to A/B test?"
- "What's your hypothesis?"
- "What's your success metric?"
- Generate A/B test setup
- "A/B test setup complete! Test configured: [details]. Ready to launch."

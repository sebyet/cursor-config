# Growth Experiments

Design and analyze growth experiments with hypothesis testing and experiment framework.

## What This Command Does

Manages growth experiments by:
- Designing experiments
- Creating hypotheses
- Setting up experiments
- Analyzing experiment results
- Generating experiment insights
- Planning experiment iterations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Experiment Goals**
   - Ask about experiment objectives
   - Identify test hypotheses
   - Understand success metrics
   - Get context on goals

2. **Design Experiment**
   - Create hypothesis
   - Define experiment design
   - Set up test variants
   - Configure test parameters
   - Plan experiment timeline

3. **Set Up Experiment**
   - Implement experiment
   - Configure A/B test
   - Set up tracking
   - Configure experiment rules
   - Test experiment setup

4. **Analyze Results**
   - Calculate experiment metrics
   - Analyze test results
   - Determine statistical significance
   - Identify winners
   - Generate insights

5. **Plan Iteration**
   - Document learnings
   - Plan next experiments
   - Create experiment roadmap
   - Generate experiment report

## What to Tell the User

- "What growth experiment do you want to run?"
- "What's your hypothesis?"
- Design and set up experiment
- "Growth experiment setup complete! Hypothesis: [details]. Test: [configured]. Analysis: [ready]"

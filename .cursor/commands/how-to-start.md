## What to Tell the User

**Opening (warm and welcoming):**
- "Welcome! I'm here to help you build features, fix problems, and deploy your work - even if you've never coded before. Don't worry, you don't need to know how to code. Just tell me what you want in plain English, and I'll handle all the technical stuff!"

**Introduce the 5 commands:**
- "Let me show you the 5 commands you'll use. Think of them like buttons on your phone - just tell them what you want in plain English:

  **`@setup`** - You want to set up a project
    Example: `@setup` → 'Set up a new project'
    Just say what you want - I'll figure out the rest!
  
  **`@build`** - You want to add or change something
    Example: `@build` → 'Add a contact form'
    Describe it in plain English - I'll build it automatically!
  
  **`@fix`** - Something isn't working
    Example: `@fix` → 'The button doesn't work'
    Just tell me what's broken - I'll fix it!
  
  **`@deploy`** - You want to publish your work online
    Example: `@deploy` → 'Publish this to the website'
    Tell me where to publish - I'll handle the rest!
  
  **`@test`** - You want to make sure everything works
    Example: `@test` → 'Check if everything works'
    I'll test everything and tell you if anything needs fixing!
  
  **That's it!** Just these 5 commands. You don't need to know about engineers, designers, or any technical roles. Just tell me what you want to do, and I'll handle all the technical stuff automatically.
  
  **Note:** Design (making things look good and accessible) happens automatically when you build features - you don't need to think about it!"

**Walk through first project:**
- "Let me walk you through your first project step by step:

  **Step 0: Set Up Your Project** (if starting fresh)
  You: `@setup`
  You: 'Set up a new project called my-app'
  Me: [I create the project, install everything, customize design]
  Me: Done! Your project is ready! ✅

  **Step 1: Build Something**
  You: `@build`
  Me: What would you like to build?
  You: 'Add a blue button that says Sign Up'
  Me: [I build it automatically, show you a preview]
  You: 'Looks good!'
  Me: Done! ✅

  **Step 2: If Something Breaks**
  You: `@fix`
  You: 'The button doesn't work'
  Me: [I find and fix the problem]
  Me: Done! ✅

  **Step 3: Publish It**
  You: `@deploy`
  You: 'Publish this to preview' (preview is a test version - safe!)
  Me: [I check everything is safe]
  Me: Published! Your work is live! ✅"

**Answer common questions:**
- "Let me answer some common questions:

  **'What if I don't know what to say?'**
  Just describe what you want in plain English! You don't need to know technical terms or which role handles what. Examples:
  - 'Add a login page'
  - 'Make the text bigger'
  - 'Add a red button'
  - 'Create a form to collect emails'
  
  I'll automatically figure out if you need an engineer, designer, or anyone else - you don't need to think about it!

  **'What if something goes wrong?'**
  Use `@fix` - just describe the problem:
  - 'The page won't load'
  - 'The button doesn't work'
  - 'Something's broken'

  **'Do I need to know how to code?'**
  No! Just describe what you want in plain English. I handle all the technical stuff.

  **'What happens after I build something?'**
  1. I build it automatically
  2. You see a preview in your browser
  3. You check if it looks good
  4. If it looks good, you say 'looks good!'
  5. I finish everything (tests, documentation, etc.)
  6. Done!

  **'What's the difference between preview and live website?'**
  - **Preview**: A test version only you can see (safe to experiment)
  - **Live website**: The real website everyone sees (be careful!)
  
  **Tip:** Always use preview first to test things!"

**Learning path:**
- "Here's a simple 3-day plan to get comfortable:

  **Day 1: Set Up and Build**
  Try: `@setup` → 'Set up a new project'
  Then: `@build` → 'Add a button'
  See how it works, get comfortable

  **Day 2: Fix Something**
  Try: `@fix` → 'The button doesn't work'
  See how problems get fixed, learn what to watch for

  **Day 3: Publish Something**
  Try: `@deploy` → 'Publish to preview'
  See your work online, share it with others"

**Closing (encouraging):**
- "Remember:
  - **You don't need to know code** - just describe what you want
  - **Everything happens automatically** - I handle the technical stuff
  - **Start simple** - build small things first, then get more complex
  - **Use preview first** - test things before making them live
  - **If stuck, just ask** - describe your problem in plain English

  **Ready to start?** 
  - New project? Try: `@setup` → 'Set up a new project'
  - Already set up? Try: `@build` → 'Add a button that says Hello'
  
  **Remember:** You only need to know these 5 commands. Just describe what you want in plain English, and I'll handle all the technical routing and work automatically!
  
  I'm here to help every step of the way! 🚀"

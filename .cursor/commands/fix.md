# Fix

**In plain English:** Something isn't working? Just tell me what's wrong, and I'll fix it automatically.

## What This Command Does

**For non-technical users:** This is like having a repair person who fixes problems automatically. Just describe what's broken in plain English, and I'll:
- Figure out what's wrong
- Fix it automatically
- Make sure everything works again
- Prevent similar problems

**Examples of what you can say:**
- "Something's broken"
- "The button doesn't work"
- "The page won't load"
- "Nothing is working"

## How It Works

1. **You tell me what's wrong**
   - Just describe the problem in plain English
   - Examples: "The button doesn't work", "The page won't load", "Something's broken"

2. **I check what's wrong**
   - I look for problems automatically
   - I tell you what I found (in simple terms)
   - I don't fix things that aren't broken

3. **I fix it automatically**
   - I fix problems one at a time
   - I make sure each fix works
   - I check for similar problems and prevent them

4. **I verify everything works**
   - I test that everything works
   - I make sure nothing else broke
   - I tell you when it's done

## Usage Examples

**Simple:**
- `@fix` → "Something's broken"
- `@fix` → "The button doesn't work"

**Specific:**
- `@fix` → "The login form isn't working"
- `@fix` → "The page won't load"

**Everything:**
- `@fix` → "Fix everything that's wrong"

## What to Tell the User

**First time users:**
- "Hi! I can help fix problems. Just tell me what's not working in plain English. For example: 'The button doesn't work' or 'Something's broken'."

**When checking:**
- "Let me check what's wrong..."
- "I found [X] problems. Let me fix them for you..."
- Explain problems in simple terms (avoid technical jargon)

**When fixing:**
- "Fixing [problem]..."
- "Fixed! Now checking if everything works..."
- "All fixed! Everything is working now."

**If nothing is wrong:**
- "I checked everything - nothing is broken! Everything looks good."

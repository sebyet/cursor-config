# Prioritize Features

Use RICE/ICE frameworks to prioritize features based on impact, effort, and strategic value.

## What This Command Does

Helps prioritize features using proven frameworks:
- **RICE**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
- **ICE**: Impact, Confidence, Ease
- Custom prioritization based on business goals

## How It Works

1. **Gather Feature List**
   - Ask for list of features to prioritize
   - Understand each feature's purpose
   - Get context on business goals

2. **Apply Framework**
   - Calculate RICE or ICE scores
   - Consider reach/impact
   - Assess confidence levels
   - Estimate effort required

3. **Generate Prioritized List**
   - Rank features by score
   - Show reasoning for each
   - Highlight high-value, low-effort wins
   - Suggest roadmap order

## What to Tell the User

- "What features do you want to prioritize?"
- "What's your primary goal? (growth, retention, revenue, etc.)"
- Apply RICE/ICE framework
- Show prioritized list with scores
- "Here's your prioritized feature list. Focus on [top features] first."

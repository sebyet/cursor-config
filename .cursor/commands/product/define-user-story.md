# Define User Story

Create user stories with acceptance criteria following agile best practices.

## What This Command Does

Generates well-structured user stories that include:
- User persona and role
- Clear "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Definition of done
- Technical notes if needed

## How It Works

1. **Understand the Feature**
   - Ask about the feature or functionality
   - Identify the user persona
   - Understand the user's goal

2. **Create User Story**
   - Format: "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Add edge cases and error states
   - Include technical considerations

3. **Review and Refine**
   - Ensure story is clear and testable
   - Verify acceptance criteria are complete
   - Add any missing context

## What to Tell the User

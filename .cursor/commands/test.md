# Test

**In plain English:** Want to make sure everything works? I'll check everything for you automatically.

## What This Command Does

**For non-technical users:** This checks that everything works properly. I'll:
- Test that everything works
- Check for problems
- Make sure the code is good quality
- Tell you if anything needs fixing

**You don't need to understand testing** - just tell me what you want checked, and I'll do it automatically.

## How It Works

1. **You tell me what to check**
   - "Run tests" = check if everything works
   - "Add tests" = add checks for a new feature
   - "Review code" = check if the code is good quality
   - "Check everything" = check all of the above

2. **I check everything**
   - I run the checks automatically
   - I look for problems
   - I check code quality

3. **I tell you the results**
   - I show you what passed
   - I tell you if anything needs fixing
   - I suggest what to do next

## Usage Examples

**Simple:**
- `@test` → "Run all tests"
- `@test` → "Check if everything works"

**Specific:**
- `@test` → "Add tests for the login feature"
- `@test` → "Review my recent changes"

**Everything:**
- `@test` → "Check everything"

## What to Tell the User

**First time users:**
- "Hi! I can help check that everything works. You can:
  - **Run tests**: Check if everything works
  - **Add tests**: Add checks for a new feature
  - **Review code**: Check if the code is good quality
  - **Check everything**: Check all of the above
  
  What would you like to check?"

**When testing:**
- "Running tests..."
- "Checking code quality..."
- "Everything looks good!" or "Found some issues: [list in simple terms]"

**Results:**
- "All tests passed! Everything works."
- "Found [X] issues. Would you like me to fix them?"
- "Code quality is good! No issues found."

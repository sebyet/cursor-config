# Create State Designs

Design empty states, error states, loading states, and other UI states to create complete user experiences.

## What This Command Does

Creates state designs that include:
- Empty state designs and messaging
- Error state designs and error messages
- Loading indicators and skeleton screens
- Success state designs
- Onboarding flow designs
- Micro-interactions and transitions

## How It Works

1. **Understand State Requirements**
   - Ask which states need to be designed
   - Identify contexts where states appear
   - Understand user goals and expectations
   - Get context on brand voice and tone
   - Determine design system constraints

2. **Design State Experiences**
   - Create empty state designs with helpful messaging
   - Design error states with clear error messages
   - Create loading indicators and skeleton screens
   - Design success state feedback
   - Create onboarding flow designs
   - Design micro-interactions and transitions

3. **Ensure Consistency**
   - Align with design system
   - Maintain brand voice and tone
   - Ensure accessibility (contrast, readability)
   - Keep messaging helpful and actionable
   - Create cohesive state experiences

4. **Generate State Design Documentation**
   - Create state design specifications
   - Document messaging and copy
   - Include visual designs or descriptions
   - Specify interactions and animations
   - Make it ready for implementation

## What to Tell the User

- "What states do you need to design?"
- "What contexts do these states appear in?"
- "What's the brand voice and tone?"
- Design state experiences
- "State designs created! States designed: [list]. Ready for implementation."

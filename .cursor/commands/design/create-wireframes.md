# Create Wireframes

Create low-fidelity wireframes and layout structures to plan information architecture and user flows before detailed design.

## What This Command Does

Creates wireframes that include:
- Page structure and layout
- Component placement and hierarchy
- Information architecture
- User flow and navigation
- Responsive breakpoint layouts
- Content structure and organization

## How It Works

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Ask about the feature or page to wireframe
   - Identify user goals and tasks
   - Understand content requirements
   - Get context on existing design system
   - Determine responsive breakpoints needed

2. **Design Wireframe Structure**
   - Plan information hierarchy
   - Layout component placement
   - Design navigation structure
   - Organize content sections
   - Create responsive variations

3. **Generate Wireframe Documentation**
   - Create wireframe layouts (text-based or code-based)
   - Document component structure
   - Specify spacing and layout relationships
   - Include annotations and notes
   - Create responsive breakpoint variations
   - Document user flow connections

4. **Create Wireframe Files**
   - Generate wireframe documentation
   - Include layout specifications
   - Add annotations for clarity
   - Create responsive variations
   - Make it ready for design handoff

## What to Tell the User

- "What feature or page do you want to wireframe?"
- "What are the main user goals for this page?"
- "What content needs to be included?"
- Create wireframe structure and layouts
- "Wireframes created! Layout structure: [summary]. Ready for detailed design."

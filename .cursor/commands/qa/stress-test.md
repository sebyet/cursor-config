# Stress Test

Perform stress testing to find breaking points and system limits.

## What This Command Does

Performs stress testing by:
- Testing beyond normal capacity
- Finding breaking points
- Identifying failure modes
- Measuring recovery time
- Generating resilience recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Stress Testing Needs**
   - Ask about system limits
   - Identify critical components
   - Understand failure scenarios
   - Determine test objectives

2. **Design Stress Test**
   - Create stress scenarios
   - Set up gradual load increase
   - Define failure criteria
   - Plan recovery testing

3. **Execute and Analyze**
   - Run stress tests
   - Measure breaking points
   - Analyze failure modes
   - Generate recommendations

## What to Tell the User

- "What components should we stress test?"
- "What are your breaking point requirements?"
- Execute stress tests and analyze results
- "Stress test complete! Breaking point: [details]. Failure modes: [list]. Recommendations: [list]"

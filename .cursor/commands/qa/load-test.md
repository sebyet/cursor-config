# Load Test

Perform load testing and capacity planning to ensure applications can handle expected traffic.

## What This Command Does

Performs load testing by:
- Creating load test scenarios
- Simulating user traffic
- Measuring response times and throughput
- Identifying bottlenecks and capacity limits
- Generating capacity planning recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Understand Load Testing Needs**
   - Ask about expected traffic
   - Identify critical endpoints
   - Understand performance requirements
   - Determine test scenarios

2. **Design Load Test**
   - Create test scenarios
   - Set up load generation
   - Define success criteria
   - Plan test execution

3. **Execute and Analyze**
   - Run load tests
   - Measure performance metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Generate recommendations

## What to Tell the User

- "What traffic levels do you need to test? (users, requests per second)"
- "What are your performance requirements? (response time, throughput)"
- Execute load tests and analyze results
- "Load test complete! Results: [summary]. Bottlenecks: [list]. Recommendations: [list]"

Concise design inspirations from industry leaders. Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions.

## Primary Design Inspirations

- **OpenAI**
  - SHOULD: Reference OpenAI's clean, minimal interface design
  - SHOULD: Study their conversational UI patterns and chat interfaces
  - SHOULD: Emulate their use of whitespace and typography hierarchy
  - SHOULD: Reference their approach to complex information presentation
  - Reference: [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)

- **Apple**
  - SHOULD: Reference Apple's design language for clarity and simplicity
  - SHOULD: Study their attention to detail in micro-interactions
  - SHOULD: Emulate their use of subtle animations and transitions
  - SHOULD: Reference their approach to product presentation and storytelling
  - Reference: [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/)

- **Airbnb**
  - SHOULD: Reference Airbnb's approach to trust-building and user experience
  - SHOULD: Study their use of high-quality imagery and visual storytelling
  - SHOULD: Emulate their search and filtering patterns
  - SHOULD: Reference their approach to mobile-first responsive design
  - Reference: [Airbnb Design](https://airbnb.design/)

## Design Principles to Extract

- Visual hierarchy
  - SHOULD: Study how these companies use size, color, and spacing to guide attention
  - SHOULD: Reference their typography choices and text hierarchy
  - SHOULD: Emulate their use of whitespace for breathing room

- Interaction patterns
  - SHOULD: Study their button styles, hover states, and feedback mechanisms
  - SHOULD: Reference their form design and validation patterns
  - SHOULD: Emulate their navigation patterns and information architecture

- Content presentation
  - SHOULD: Study how they present complex information simply
  - SHOULD: Reference their use of progressive disclosure
  - SHOULD: Emulate their approach to empty states and error handling

- Visual polish
  - SHOULD: Study their attention to detail in spacing and alignment
  - SHOULD: Reference their use of subtle shadows and depth
  - SHOULD: Emulate their consistent use of design tokens

## Application

- When designing new features
  - SHOULD: Reference these inspirations for similar patterns
  - SHOULD: Adapt their approaches to fit our design system
  - MUST: Maintain consistency with our existing design system
  - NEVER: Copy designs directly without adaptation

- When making design decisions
  - SHOULD: Ask "How would [OpenAI/Apple/Airbnb] handle this?"
  - SHOULD: Reference their solutions for similar problems
  - MUST: Ensure solutions fit our brand and user needs

## Design Inspirations {#design-inspirations}

_Summary: Reference these products for proven patterns, interaction design, and visual excellence. Study their approaches before inventing new patterns._

- **Default references**
  - **Airbnb** – Exceptional search and filtering UX, image-first content presentation, trust-building through reviews and verification, clear pricing transparency, mobile-first responsive design.
  - **OpenAI** – Clean, minimal interfaces for complex AI interactions, clear information hierarchy, excellent loading states and progressive disclosure, thoughtful error handling and user guidance.
  - **Dia Browser** – Modern browser UI patterns, efficient space utilization, smooth transitions, intuitive navigation, polished micro-interactions.
- **How to use**
  - MUST study these references before designing similar features; understand the "why" behind their patterns, not just copy the "what".
  - SHOULD analyze their information architecture, interaction patterns, and visual hierarchy when facing similar design challenges.
  - SHOULD reference specific patterns (e.g., "Airbnb's date picker approach" or "OpenAI's streaming response pattern") when proposing solutions.
  - AVOID copying without understanding context; adapt patterns to fit your product's unique needs and constraints.

## Experience Delivery Flow

_Summary: Follow this order whenever shaping UX/UI work to keep intent, implementation, and polish aligned._

1. **Study references** – Review relevant patterns from [Design Inspirations](#design-inspirations) to understand proven approaches before designing.
2. **Context first** – Clarify the task, entry points, success metric, and how often the surface is used. Reference [Self-Evident Experience](#self-evident-experience).
3. **Structure the narrative** – Map information hierarchy, navigation depth, and form flows ([Navigation & Forms](#navigation-and-forms)).
4. **Apply the system** – Choose existing vibecamp components and semantic tokens ([Design System & Tailwind Delivery](#design-system-and-tailwind-delivery)).
5. **Refine interactions** – Ensure accessibility, feedback, URL/state sync, and touch behaviors ([Interactions & Accessibility](#interactions-and-accessibility)).
6. **Add motion deliberately** – Only if it clarifies cause/effect or adds rare delight; select the right pattern and tooling ([Motion Principles](#motion-principles), [Motion Patterns](#motion-patterns), [Framer Motion & Testing](#framer-motion-and-testing)). See [Frontend Developer > Animations](mdc:.cursor/rules/full-stack-engineering.mdc#animations) for implementation.
7. **Benchmark & QA** – Compare against [Design Inspirations](#design-inspirations) references, test reduced motion, low-power devices, and copy polish before shipping.

## Self-Evident Experience {#self-evident-experience}

_Summary: Interfaces must explain themselves instantly—borrowed from “Don’t Make Me Think.”_

- **Clarity**
  - MUST keep each screen self-evident: primary action is obvious, grouping follows hierarchy, entry points are unmistakable.
  - MUST size/position the most important elements for immediate recognition; NEVER make users guess what’s clickable.
  - SHOULD reuse proven patterns; new paradigms require explicit cues.
- **User behavior truths**
  - MUST design for scanning (headlines, bullets, whitespace) because users skim.
  - MUST assume mistakes will happen; provide undo, retries, and autosave for long inputs.
  - MUST give instant feedback for every action (loading, success, error).
- **Content & copy**
  - MUST remove fluff: active voice, concrete nouns, no jargon.
  - MUST make headlines descriptive and keyword-rich; match page content exactly.
  - MUST ensure color is never the sole carrier of meaning; pair icons/text/patterns.
  - SHOULD cut instructions in half and show examples rather than paragraphs.
- **Performance perception**
  - MUST use skeletons/placeholders over blank states, show progress for long work, and favor optimistic UI with reconciliation/rollback paths.

## Navigation & Forms {#navigation-and-forms}

_Summary: Keep users oriented, reduce steps, and give crystal-clear validation guidance._

- **Navigation**
  - MUST provide persistent nav with active states/breadcrumbs; MUST match labels to user mental models.
  - MUST indicate progress for multi-step flows, and NEVER create dead ends—always offer next/recovery actions.
  - SHOULD surface search prominently and make thumb-friendly primary actions on mobile.
- **Forms & inputs**
  - MUST pair every input with an explicit label (never rely on placeholder-only); required fields are clearly marked.
  - MUST pre-fill known data, validate in real time, and allow submissions even if validation fails so errors surface inline.
  - MUST place errors nearest the field, include why + fix instructions, and focus the first error upon submit.
  - MUST keep inputs hydration-safe, allow paste (especially OTPs/passwords), support password managers/2FA, and warn before abandoning unsaved work.
  - SHOULD include examples via placeholders that end with ellipsis, trim trailing spaces, and disable spellcheck for usernames/emails/codes.

## Interactions & Accessibility {#interactions-and-accessibility}

_Summary: Baseline interaction contract drawn from the web interface guidelines—keyboard, touch, feedback, and content resilience._

- **Keyboard & focus**
  - MUST implement full keyboard support per WAI-ARIA APG, including focus traps/return for dialogs.
  - MUST show visible focus via `:focus-visible` (and `:focus-within` on groups); NEVER hide focus for keyboard paths.
- **Hit targets & touch**
  - MUST provide ≥24px hit targets (mobile comfort ≥44px) even if the visual target is smaller.
  - MUST set `touch-action: manipulation`, respect browser zoom, and never disable pinch/zoom.
  - MUST handle drag/scroll with `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals and disable text selection during drags.
  - SHOULD delay the first tooltip, then show subsequent peers instantly with no animation.
- **State & navigation**
  - MUST keep URLs in sync with shareable state (filters, tabs, pagination) and honor back/forward history + scroll position.
  - MUST use anchors for navigation (supporting Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click); buttons mutate state only.
- **Feedback & messaging**
  - SHOULD prefer optimistic UI while syncing with the server; on failure, show actionable error + rollback or Undo.
  - MUST confirm destructive work or provide an Undo window; MUST use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation.
- **Content resilience**
  - MUST craft empty, sparse, dense, loading, and error states.
  - MUST ensure icons without text have `aria-label`, decorative items are `aria-hidden`, and headings use a proper hierarchy with `scroll-margin-top` for anchors.
  - MUST design for UGC extremes (very short/long strings) and keep locale-aware formatting for dates/times/numbers/currency.
- **Performance & layout**
  - MUST animate only compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`), virtualize large lists, reserve image space, and batch layout reads/writes.
  - SHOULD test iOS Low Power Mode, Safari, and throttled CPU/network to ensure responsiveness.

## Design System & Tailwind Delivery {#design-system-and-tailwind-delivery}

_Summary: Ship everything through the vibecamp system, semantic tokens, and Tailwind best practices. For implementation details, see [Frontend Developer > UI Components & Styling](mdc:.cursor/rules/full-stack-engineering.mdc#ui-components--styling)._

- **Component reuse**
  - MUST pull from `components/ui/*` before attempting bespoke builds; NEVER fork when a design-system primitive exists.
  - MUST use built-in variants (`default`, `outline`, `destructive`, `ghost`, etc.) before inventing new props.
- **Tokens & colors**
  - MUST reference semantic tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, etc.) instead of hard-coded hex/rgb/hsl.
  - MUST define tokens as CSS variables in `globals.css` and consume them through Tailwind config; NEVER inline brand colors inside components.
- **Accessibility with utilities**
  - MUST provide focus rings (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2`) and enforce contrast (APCA preferred) in both light/dark themes.

## Motion Principles {#motion-principles}

_Summary: Motion exists to clarify, not distract—drawn from Emil Kowalski’s philosophy._

- **Purpose first**
  - MUST ensure every animation delivers feedback, explains state change, or adds rare delight; NEVER animate for its own sake.
- **Frequency**
  - MUST remove animations from high-frequency interactions (command menus, keyboard navigation, hover loops); medium frequency gets minimal motion; low frequency can host richer delight.
  - NEVER animate keyboard-initiated focus changes or routes visited dozens of times per day.
- **Perceived speed & easing**
  - MUST keep UI motion under 300 ms (dropdowns ≈180 ms, tooltips 125 ms) and default to `ease-out` or tuned springs.
  - SHOULD avoid `scale(0)` starts—begin near 0.9 for natural feels; set transform origins to the trigger point.
- **Taste & critique**
  - SHOULD regularly study Linear, Raycast, Apple, etc., and articulate _why_ an animation feels right or wrong.
  - SHOULD embrace the “taste gap”: early attempts may lag behind taste; iterate and solicit critique.
- **Accessibility & control**
  - MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion` with reduced variants or near-instant transitions.
  - MUST make animations interruptible/input-driven; autoplay only when absolutely necessary (e.g., passive ambient loops).

## Motion Patterns {#motion-patterns}

_Summary: Canonical patterns for feedback, overlays, lists, loading, and gesture-heavy surfaces._

- **Micro-feedback**
  - MUST add subtle `whileTap` scale (~0.97) or active-state transforms on buttons.
  - SHOULD add shake/scale cues for error/success yet keep them ≤500 ms and non-startling.
- **Tooltips & overlays**
  - MUST delay the first tooltip, then show subsequent ones instantly; scale/pop from trigger origin with `transform-origin` tokens.
  - MUST animate modal backdrops (≈200 ms fade) and content (spring from `scale 0.95 → 1`, small `y` offset); exits slightly faster.
- **Lists & layout**
  - MUST animate list add/remove with `layout` + `AnimatePresence` to preserve spatial memory; keep exit durations ≤200 ms.
  - SHOULD stagger small lists (50–100 ms) but NEVER for high-frequency feeds.
- **Page & route transitions**
  - SHOULD use subtle (≤20px) translations around 150–250 ms when spatial context matters; skip for frequently visited routes/back navigation where immediacy wins.
- **Loading & progress**
  - MUST animate skeleton shimmer, spinner rotation via `transform`, and progress bars with smooth `ease-out`. Faster spinning increases perceived speed.
- **Scroll & gesture triggers**
  - SHOULD use `useInView` / Intersection Observer with `once: true` for scroll reveals (20–50 px travel) and springs for drag/snap gestures.
  - MUST disable text selection during drag, set thresholds for swipe actions, and provide elastic resistance.
- **Composition & pitfalls**
  - MUST focus on 2–3 properties per animation, avoid animating layout props, and never block pointer events while animating.
  - SHOULD use blur as a last-resort blend between states when other tweaks fail.

## Framer Motion & Testing {#framer-motion-and-testing}

_Summary: Testing and QA guidance for motion-heavy surfaces. For implementation details, see [Frontend Developer > Animations](mdc:.cursor/rules/full-stack-engineering.mdc#animations)._

- **Testing regimen**
  - SHOULD test motion on low-end hardware, throttled CPU/network, Safari, and with `prefers-reduced-motion` toggled.
  - MUST verify screen readers announce content changes (not animation), keyboard paths stay instant, and interrupted animations recover gracefully.
  - SHOULD profile with Chrome Performance, watch for layout thrash, and keep frame rates near 60 fps.

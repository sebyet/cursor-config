# UI/UX Review Checklist

Use this checklist to review UI/UX work before merging. Validate both user experience and technical implementation.

## Pre-Merge Checklist

### Accessibility
- MUST: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- MUST: Verify focus indicators are visible and logical
- MUST: Check screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- MUST: Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA minimum (prefer APCA)
- MUST: Images have descriptive `alt` text or `aria-hidden` if decorative
- MUST: Form inputs have associated labels (not placeholders only)
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Interactive elements announce their state (`aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, etc.)
- MUST: Error messages are associated with fields (`aria-describedby` or `aria-invalid`)
- SHOULD: Test with reduced motion enabled (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

### Responsive Design
- MUST: Test on mobile viewport (320px - 768px)
- MUST: Test on tablet viewport (768px - 1024px)
- MUST: Test on desktop viewport (1024px+)
- MUST: Test on ultra-wide (simulate at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Verify touch targets ≥44px on mobile
- MUST: Check safe areas on iOS (notch/home indicator)
- MUST: Verify no horizontal scrolling on any viewport
- MUST: Check text remains readable at all sizes
- SHOULD: Test landscape orientation on mobile

### Cross-Browser Testing
- MUST: Test in Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- MUST: Test in Safari (macOS/iOS)
- MUST: Test in Firefox
- SHOULD: Test on iOS Safari (real device if possible)
- MUST: Verify CSS Grid/Flexbox work correctly
- MUST: Check form inputs render correctly
- MUST: Verify animations work (or have fallbacks)

### Performance
- MUST: Check Lighthouse score (≥90 for Performance)
- MUST: Verify no layout shift (CLS < 0.1)
- MUST: Images are optimized and lazy-loaded below fold
- MUST: Verify no console errors or warnings
- MUST: Check network requests (minimize, batch when possible)
- SHOULD: Test on slow 3G connection
- MUST: Mutations (`POST/PATCH/DELETE`) feel fast (<500ms perceived)
- SHOULD: Profile with React DevTools (minimize re-renders)

## Visual Design Review

### Typography
- MUST: Use consistent font sizes from design system
- MUST: Maintain proper line height (1.5-1.75 for body text)
- MUST: Use appropriate font weights (not too many variations)
- MUST: Verify text is readable (contrast, size)
- SHOULD: Use tabular numbers for comparisons
- MUST: Avoid widows/orphans in text

### Spacing & Layout
- MUST: Use consistent spacing scale (avoid arbitrary values)
- MUST: Verify alignment to grid/baseline (no accidental placement)
- MUST: Check visual balance (icon/text lockups)
- MUST: Verify whitespace is generous (not cramped)
- SHOULD: Apply optical alignment adjustments (±1px when needed)

### Color & Styling
- MUST: Use semantic color tokens (not hardcoded colors)
- MUST: Verify color is not the only way to convey information
- MUST: Check hover/focus states increase contrast
- SHOULD: Verify hue consistency (borders/shadows match background)
- MUST: Charts use color-blind-friendly palettes
- MUST: Verify dark mode support (if applicable)

### Component Consistency
- MUST: Use design system components (not custom implementations)
- MUST: Use component variants correctly
- MUST: Verify similar components behave similarly
- MUST: Check hover/active states are consistent
- MUST: Verify shadows/layers follow design system

## UX Review Criteria

### Self-Evident Design
- MUST: Page purpose is clear at a glance
- MUST: Most important elements are most prominent
- MUST: Related elements are grouped together
- MUST: Clear entry points for actions
- NEVER: Users must guess what something does
- MUST: Use familiar patterns (don't reinvent the wheel)

### Content
- MUST: Headlines are descriptive (not clever)
- MUST: Content is scannable (bullets, whitespace, hierarchy)
- MUST: Eliminate needless words (no marketing speak)
- MUST: Instructions are concise and actionable
- MUST: Use active voice (not passive)

### Navigation
- MUST: Current location is clear (active states, breadcrumbs)
- MUST: Navigation labels match user mental models
- MUST: URL reflects state (deep-linkable)
- MUST: Back/Forward buttons restore scroll
- MUST: Links support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click

### Forms
- MUST: Every input has a visible label
- MUST: Required fields are clearly marked
- MUST: Validation happens in real-time
- MUST: Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix
- MUST: Success states confirm completion
- MUST: Forms are compatible with password managers
- MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios

### Error Handling
- MUST: Errors are in plain language (no technical jargon)
- MUST: Errors appear near the relevant field/action
- MUST: Errors are visually distinct (color + icon + text)
- MUST: Always provide a way forward (retry, alternative)
- MUST: Confirm destructive actions before execution
- MUST: Provide Undo for destructive actions (when possible)

### States & Feedback
- MUST: Loading states show progress (spinners, skeletons)
- MUST: No blank screens during loading
- MUST: Immediate feedback for user actions
- MUST: Optimistic UI with rollback on failure
- MUST: Empty states are helpful (not just "No items")
- MUST: Error states guide recovery

## Testing Checklist

### Keyboard Navigation
- MUST: Tab order is logical
- MUST: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- MUST: Focus is trapped in modals/drawers
- MUST: Escape closes modals/dialogs
- MUST: Enter submits forms
- MUST: Arrow keys work in menus/lists

### Touch Interactions
- MUST: Touch targets ≥44px on mobile
- MUST: No accidental taps (spacing between targets)
- MUST: Drag interactions are forgiving
- MUST: Scroll works smoothly
- MUST: No double-tap zoom on buttons

### Form Validation
- MUST: Real-time validation doesn't block typing
- MUST: Validation errors appear inline
- MUST: Focus moves to first error on submit
- MUST: Invalid fields are clearly marked
- MUST: Error messages are dismissible

### Edge Cases
- MUST: Design handles short content (min height)
- MUST: Design handles very long content (scrolling, truncation)
- MUST: Design handles empty states
- MUST: Design handles error states
- MUST: Design handles loading states
- MUST: Design handles dense/sparse data

## Common Issues to Watch For

- NEVER: Disable browser zoom
- NEVER: Block paste in inputs
- NEVER: Hide important features
- NEVER: Use color alone to convey information
- NEVER: Create dead ends (always offer recovery)
- NEVER: Make users guess what to do
- MUST: Verify internationalization (dates, numbers, currency)
- MUST: Check RTL support (if applicable)

Concise UX/UI principles for building self-evident, intuitive interfaces. Primarily based on Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" framework, with complementary principles from cognitive psychology and modern UX patterns. Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions.

## Self-Evident Design

- MUST: Every page be self-evident and self-explanatory at a glance—users understand what they're looking at and what they can do without thinking
- MUST: Most important elements be most prominent (size, color, position)
- MUST: Group related elements together; create clear visual hierarchy
- MUST: Provide clear entry points for each page
- NEVER: Make users guess what something does or where to click
- SHOULD: Use familiar patterns and conventions users already know

## User Behavior Principles

- MUST: Assume users don't read everything on the page (they scan)
- MUST: Design for scanning (headlines, bullets, whitespace)
- MUST: Users make mistakes—provide recovery options
- MUST: Users are in a hurry—respect their time (be fast, clear)
- MUST: Users don't care how your system works—just that it works
- SHOULD: Remove unnecessary steps (reduce clicks, reduce forms)
- MUST: Provide clear feedback for every action (loading, success, error)

## Content

- Eliminate needless words
  - MUST: Remove marketing speak and corporate jargon
  - MUST: Use active voice instead of passive
  - MUST: Be specific, not vague
  - SHOULD: Cut instructions in half (remove words that don't add value)
  - MUST: Remove redundant explanations
- Meaningful headlines
  - MUST: Headlines be descriptive, not clever
  - MUST: Use keywords users would search for
  - MUST: Purpose be obvious at a glance
  - MUST: Headlines match page content exactly
- Scannable content
  - MUST: Use bullet points for lists
  - SHOULD: Break up long paragraphs (keep concise)
  - MUST: Use bold/emphasis for key terms (not decorative)
  - SHOULD: Use visual hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3) that matches content structure
- Accessible content
  - MUST: Color not be the only way to convey information (use icons, text, patterns)

## Navigation

- Site navigation
  - MUST: Persistent navigation on every page
  - MUST: Clear current location indicators (active states, breadcrumbs)
  - MUST: Breadcrumbs for navigation depth > 2 levels
  - SHOULD: Prominently place search functionality
  - MUST: Navigation labels match user mental models (not internal jargon)
- Page navigation
  - MUST: Page titles match user expectations and content
  - MUST: Logical flow from one step to the next (no dead ends)
  - MUST: Progress indicators for multi-step processes (show current step and total)
  - MUST: Clear entry and exit points for each page section
- Mobile navigation
  - SHOULD: Thumb-friendly navigation (bottom placement for primary actions)

## Forms

- Labels and instructions
  - MUST: Every input have a clear, visible label
  - MUST: Labels be above or next to inputs (not placeholders only)
  - MUST: Instructions be concise and actionable
  - SHOULD: Show examples instead of describing format
  - MUST: Required fields be clearly marked
- Smart defaults and validation
  - MUST: Pre-fill known information (avoid re-entry)
  - MUST: Validate in real-time with helpful messages
  - MUST: Show progress for multi-step forms (step X of Y)
  - MUST: Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it
  - MUST: Success states confirm completion clearly

## Error Handling

- Clear error messages
  - MUST: Errors be in plain language (no technical jargon)
  - MUST: Errors explain what went wrong and why
  - MUST: Errors appear near the relevant field/action
  - MUST: Errors be visually distinct (color + icon + text)
  - MUST: Errors be dismissible once resolved
- Recovery options
  - MUST: Always provide a way forward (next step, retry, alternative)
  - MUST: Confirm destructive actions before execution
  - MUST: Provide Undo for destructive actions (time window)
  - SHOULD: Auto-save drafts to prevent data loss
  - MUST: Clear instructions for fixing problems
  - MUST: No dead ends; always offer recovery path

## Performance & Feedback

- Perceived performance
  - MUST: Show immediate feedback for user actions (optimistic UI)
  - MUST: Show progress for long operations (loading states, spinners)
  - MUST: Use skeletons or placeholders (not blank screens)
  - MUST: Progressive loading (show what's ready, load rest later)

## Common Mistakes

- Overwhelming users
  - NEVER: Present too many options at once (progressive disclosure)
  - NEVER: Use jargon or technical terms without explanation
  - NEVER: Assume users know how your system works
  - MUST: Limit choices (magic number is 7±2 items)
- Hidden functionality
  - NEVER: Hide important features (make them discoverable)
  - MUST: Make actions discoverable (clear affordances)
  - MUST: Use familiar patterns (don't reinvent the wheel)
  - MUST: Provide clear affordances (visual cues for interactivity)
  - MUST: If it looks clickable, it must be clickable

The goal: Create interfaces so intuitive that users accomplish their tasks without thinking about how to use the interface itself.

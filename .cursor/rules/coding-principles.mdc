# KISS & DRY Coding Principles

You are an expert developer who follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Apply these principles consistently throughout the codebase.

## KISS Principle - Keep It Simple, Stupid

### Core Philosophy
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Readability over cleverness**: Code should be easy to understand
- **Maintainability over optimization**: Write code that's easy to modify
- **Clarity over brevity**: Clear code is better than short code

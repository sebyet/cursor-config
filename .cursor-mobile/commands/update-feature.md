# Update Feature

To update an existing feature in your React Native app, always tell the user to follow these steps:

1. **Describe the feature you want to modify**
   - Tell me which feature you want to modify
   - Explain what changes you want to make
   - Be as specific as possible about the modifications needed
   - Mention if changes affect iOS, Android, or both platforms

2. **Switch to plan mode**
   - Use plan mode to review the proposed changes
   - Reply to any questions that come up
   - Consider platform-specific requirements

3. **Click on build**
   - Once you've reviewed the plan, click build to implement the modifications
   - The updates will be made with React Native best practices
   - Platform-specific code will be handled appropriately

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

When updating features, consider:

- **Platform differences:** Do the changes need different behavior on iOS vs Android?
- **Navigation:** Does this affect navigation flows?
- **Performance:** Will the changes impact performance (animations, list rendering)?
- **Keyboard handling:** Does this affect keyboard interactions?
- **Native modules:** Do the changes require native code updates?

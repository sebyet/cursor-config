# Build Feature

To add a new feature to your React Native app, always tell the user to follow these steps:

1. **Describe the feature you want to add**
   - Tell me what feature you want to add
   - Be as specific as possible about what you need
   - Mention if it's a screen, component, navigation flow, or native module

2. **Switch to plan mode**
   - Use plan mode to review the proposed changes
   - Reply to any questions that come up
   - Consider platform-specific requirements (iOS vs Android)

3. **Click on build**
   - Once you've reviewed the plan, click build to implement the feature
   - The feature will be built with React Native best practices
   - Platform-specific code will be handled appropriately

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

When building features, consider:

- **Navigation:** How does this feature fit into your navigation structure?
- **Platform differences:** Does this need different behavior on iOS vs Android?
- **Native modules:** Does this require native code or can it be done in JavaScript?
- **Performance:** Will this feature need optimization (virtualized lists, memoization)?
- **Keyboard handling:** Does this feature interact with the keyboard?
- **Animations:** Should this feature have smooth animations?

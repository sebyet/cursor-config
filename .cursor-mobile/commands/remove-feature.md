# Remove Feature

To remove a feature from your React Native app, always tell the user to follow these steps:

1. **Describe the feature you want to delete**
   - Tell me which feature you want to delete
   - Be as specific as possible about what needs to be removed
   - Mention if it includes screens, components, navigation routes, or native modules

2. **Switch to plan mode**
   - Use plan mode to review what will be deleted
   - Reply to any questions that come up
   - Verify dependencies and references to the feature

3. **Click on build**
   - Once you've reviewed the plan, click build to delete the feature
   - All related code, screens, navigation routes, and dependencies will be removed
   - Platform-specific code will be cleaned up appropriately

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

When removing features, consider:

- **Navigation:** Remove navigation routes and screen references
- **Dependencies:** Clean up unused imports and dependencies
- **Native modules:** Remove native module code if no longer needed
- **Platform code:** Clean up iOS and Android specific code
- **State management:** Remove related state and stores

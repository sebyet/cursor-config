# Fix Compile Errors

Fixes compilation errors in your code so your project can build successfully. Finds TypeScript errors, syntax issues, missing imports, and type mismatches - then fixes them automatically.

1. **Find compilation errors**
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Check for syntax errors
   - Check for missing imports
   - Check for type mismatches
   - Check for undefined variables or functions
   - Tell the user what you found

2. **Fix compilation errors**
   - Fix TypeScript errors (type issues, missing types)
   - Fix syntax errors (missing brackets, quotes, etc.)
   - Add missing imports
   - Fix type mismatches
   - Fix undefined references
   - Show what you're fixing

3. **Verify it compiles**
   - Check that all errors are fixed
   - Verify the project builds successfully
   - Make sure nothing broke
   - Tell them when it's done!

## What to Tell the User

- Explain you're checking for compilation errors
- List what errors you found (e.g., "Found 3 TypeScript errors and 1 missing import...")
- Fix errors one by one, explaining what you're fixing
- Show progress as you fix each error
- Verify the project compiles after fixes
- Tell them when all compilation errors are fixed
